# file-size

By default this hook will stop the committing of any files above 1MB. Large files should be dependencies of a project, rather than included in the project itself. Alternatively, some large files can be generated by the build and added to the `.gitignore`. If you need to turn this hook off you can:

```sh
git config hooks.file-size.disabled true
```

Or if you need to change the maximum file size you can

```sh
git config hooks.file-size.bytes $x
```

Where `$x` is the maximum number of bytes for a file. You can also customise the error message.

```sh
git config hooks.file-size.message "Your message here"
```

The name of the file that cannot be committed will be printed immediately after your message on the same line.
